To initialize the backend :
cd backend
npm install
npm start

after these line, the terminal should run:

If i had no limitations, I would prefer GraphQL for api, and Prisma for backend.

In this app there are basicly 4 things you can do. You can create, update, delete and read a To-Do Item. Basicly all the CRUD. I have not implemented multiple selection neither drag and drop feature. I had 2 days and for 1.5 day i was sick.

Initially i was planning on installing react-dnd-beautiful package for drag and drop feature. It would need to update the backend since lexorank should be added as well.

Also all the items in our todos includes a status variable. But i couldn't find what to do with them.

The toDo items has many to one relations with users.
